# DISCORD PLEX TRIAL BOT
A Discord bot for sending Plex invites and removing users from the Plex server after a trial period has ended.
<br />
<br />
# HOW IT WORKS
The bot will DM any user who has a specfic role asking the user to reply with their Plex email address. When a user replies with their email address the bot will automtically send the user an invite to the Plex server. Once the trial period has ended the bot will automatically remove the user from the Plex server. 
<br />
<br />
All trials begin from the time the invite was sent, and a user can only request one trial, if they try to request another one, they will recieve a denial message. The bot checks for trials to remove users every 15 minutes, this even includes invites that were sent and not accepted. 
<br />
<br />
If you want to change the timeframe the bot checks for removing trials, you can edit the code on line 106 `minutes=15`. You can change it to any amount of any unit of time you would like. **Examples:** `seconds=30` or `hours=1`
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Reaction Roles are a great way to fully automate your trials, otherwise if you want to have more control over your invites, you can manually add the role to the user.*
<br />
<br />
### LOGGING
You can set the bot to log all actions to a specified channle of your choice
<br />
<br />
### DATABASE
There is a sqlite database file that will automatically be made upon starting the bot. You can view and make modifications to the file, in case a user replies with an incorrect email address, or you want to make adjustments. Simply remove the entry from the database, then the user can make a new request for a trial. 
<br />
<br />
### MESSAGES
You can set custom messages that the bot will DM user with. 
- When a user is denied from trying to request another trial before their cooldown period has ended.
- When an invite has successfully been sent after replying with a confirmed Plex email address.
- When the users trial has ended.
